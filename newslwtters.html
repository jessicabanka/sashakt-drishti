              <p>IGDTUW has taken diverse initiatives setting
                international benchmarks not only in the academic
                domain but also in addressing pressing issues of
                society. The University has made an impact at the
                individual, family and community levels.
                The university has launched highly successful social
                outreach initiatives through the Centre for Sustainable
                Development aimed at working towards the United
                Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Six teams,
                working under CSD, cover 11 different SDG Goals. All
                the teams have launched comprehensive campaigns
                about pressing issues related to the SDGs and have
                disseminated knowledge to more than a thousand
                students at large.
                Our objective to create social leaders that are sensitive
                towards the preservation of the environment have in
                turn, sensitized the general public too, and the team’s
                tremendous accomplishments have brought in results.
                I’m sure that the endeavours of our students will reach
                out to the readers of this newsletter and bring about a
                transformation in the way that they perceive their lives
                and the lives of others. I wish all the best to the CSD
                team!</p>

                <P>Adira took the initiative to prepare
                  students in class XII for their board exams.
                  For the first 60 minutes, students practised
                  for their Term - 1 board exams by taking an
                  MCQ- based Mock test.
                  This test was then followed by a surprise
                  session by honourable Mr Manoj Sethi and
                  Mrs Garima Pant, who addressed the
                  students and answered their questions
                  about their careers as well as board exam
                  strategies.</P>

                <p>ADIRA organized an event: "Chalk Graffiti" at
                  Taarangana '22 to raise awareness. During
                  the event, all interested onlookers were
                  encouraged to express their thoughts using
                  chalk, with the roads as a blank canvas, filled
                  with ideas and thoughts of the students.
                  The initiative of 'Sustainable Sundays' was
                  launched by Cognito wherein posts were
                  released on the social media handles
                  every Sunday to shed some light on the
                  ways to reduce carbon footprints by
                  adopting Green Computing methods.
                  Some of the topics we covered were E-waste, Shutting down computer every
                  night etc.</p>

                  initiative organized by Adira, in collaboration
                  with Girlup Aadya. Mentors and students
                  were required to make a 2-3 minute video
                  explaining a topic from various subjects.
                  These videos would then be uploaded on
                  youtube in the form of playlists for the
                  benefit of students in class 11 and 12.
